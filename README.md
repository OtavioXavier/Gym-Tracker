# Gym Tracker

**Gym Tracker** is a website to track your daily weight training workouts. Using gym_tracker, you have the ability to store the weight, difficulty, and repetitions for each set done in your workouts. All this data is stored so you can access the information through charts on a dashboard or a spreadsheet (this data can be exported to xlsx). Additionally, you can track your progress with a photo album, with pictures taken weekly or daily.
